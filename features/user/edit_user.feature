  As Peter
  I need to be able to edit a user

    Given the "apparel" catalog configuration
    And I am logged in as "admin"

  Scenario: Successfully edit a user
    Given I edit the "admin" user
    When I fill in the following information:
      | First name | John  |
      | Last name  | Smith |
      | Owner      | Main  |
    And I save the user
    Then I should see "User saved"
    And I should see "John Smith"

  Scenario: Successfully edit and apply user preferences
    And an enabled "teapot" product

    And I should see "Print"
    And I should see "2015 MÃ¤nner-Kollektion"
